# Network Scanner Requirements
# ------------------------------
# This project uses only Python's built-in standard library modules.
# No external dependencies are required to run the main script.

# Standard libraries used:
# os, time, subprocess, threading, socket

# Optional dependencies for extended functionality:
# scapy>=2.5.0     # Enables ARP/ICMP-based scanning (requires Npcap on Windows)
# ping3>=4.0.4     # For ICMP ping without elevated permissions
# tqdm>=4.66.0     # Adds a progress bar for large IP ranges
